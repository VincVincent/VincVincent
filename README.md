Hello! My name is Vincent and I'm an eighteen year old Swedish art student.
I've taken an interest to coding as I've enrolled in an entrepreneurship class and want to be able to build and maintain my own website.
I'm also interested in game development and social networking via the internet. Currently my coding skills are below apprentice level but I'm determined to seek improvement.
As a person I'm somewhat aloof, quaint, particular. I'm very curious and try to live my life as I see fit.
During my free time I enjoy spending time with friends and my dog, Leia, as well as playing games, writing poetry, drawing, etc.
